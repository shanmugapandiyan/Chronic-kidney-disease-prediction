# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on predicting chronic kidney disease using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately diagnose the presence of kidney disease based on relevant medical data.

## Features
- Utilizes a dataset of medical records to train and test the predictive model.
- Implements machine learning algorithms for classification and prediction.
- Provides insights into key factors contributing to the prediction of chronic kidney disease.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/perarulalan15/chronic-kidney-disease.git
   cd chronic-kidney-disease
   ```

## Results
Include insights, accuracy metrics, and any visualizations obtained from the model evaluation.

## Contributing
